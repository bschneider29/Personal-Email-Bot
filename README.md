The program is written as a Jupyter Notebook. This can be converted to an executable .py file. Features within the program were leveraged and modified from other online sources. The program relays specific news stories, sport scores, weather, and stocks from a bot email address to a list of receipents. The goal was to provide myself with daily consolidated information tailored to my interests. Some information is web scrapped while others are parsed from an API. There are no local stored dependencies.
